## :orange_book: What is Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting (PRF)?

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.002"><img src="docs/Structural-diversity.png" height="400" align="center" /></a>
- From [*Mauger et al., 2013, FEBS Letters*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.03.002)

Ribosomal frameshifting, also known as translational frameshifting or translational recoding, is a biological phenomenon 
that occurs during translation that results in the production of multiple, unique proteins from a single mRNA. 
The process can be programmed by the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA and is sometimes affected by the secondary, 3-dimensional mRNA structure.
It has been described mainly in viruses (especially retroviruses), retrotransposons and bacterial insertion elements, and also in some cellular genes.
